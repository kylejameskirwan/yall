Yet Another Legal Language

This project is not currently offered with a license because I haven't yet decided how to share this work, if it ever develops into something useful (a big "if").

Yall is inspired by the amount of manual labor still present in the field of lawyer'in and attorney'in and professional opine'in. It seems clear that there are parallels to software engineering: requires collaboration within and between firms, uses prior art, centers primarily on text and text editing, benefits from version control tools, etc. Conversations with practicioners lead me to believe a lot of the work is very manual, fragile, and opaque to non-lawyers.

Yall aims to explore applying software engineering concepts to legal documents, by making it easier for practicioners (who are not software engineers) to make use of concepts like write-once-use-often, version control, etc.

Of course I'm not the first person to see opportunities in this space, this is just my exploration of it personally.
